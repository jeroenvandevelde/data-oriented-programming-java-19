# Data Oriented Programming in Java 19

_Data-oriented programming encourages us to model data as (immutable) data, 
and keep the code that embodies the business logic of how we act on that data separately._  
ⓒ Brian Goetz

_When we're modeling complex entities, OO techniques have a lot to offer us. 
But when we're modeling simple services that process plain, ad-hoc data, the techniques of data-oriented programming may offer us a straighter path._
