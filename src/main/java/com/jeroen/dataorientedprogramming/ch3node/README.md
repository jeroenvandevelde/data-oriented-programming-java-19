# Design and build a data structure in a data oriented programming way and solve the below problem.

- ## We have a node that can exist of one or two entries.
- ## We want to be able to add (two entries), multiply (two entries), negate (one entry), Math.exp (one entry) them. 
  - ### Example for add: Add has two entries, so we need to calculate: entry1 + entry2
  - ### Example for negate: negate has entry, so we need to calculate: -entry1
- ## We want to be able to print out the calculations: add (two entries), multiply (two entries), negate (one entry), Math.exp (one entry).
  - ### Example for add: Add should print "entry1 + entry2"
